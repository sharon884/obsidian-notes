## **HTTP Server (built-in Node.js module)**

- Node.js has a built-in module called `http`.
    
- It lets you create a **basic web server**.
    
- You handle **everything manually**: parsing URLs, handling routes, sending responses, etc.
    
- Minimal, low-level, but flexible.




## **Express Server (built on top of HTTP)**

- **Express** is a framework built **on top of Node’s HTTP module**.
    
- It provides lots of **shortcuts and utilities** so you don’t have to write boilerplate code.
    
- Handles routing, middleware, JSON parsing, error handling, etc.
    
- Cleaner, faster to build real apps.
