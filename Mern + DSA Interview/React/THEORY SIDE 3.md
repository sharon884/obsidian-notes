Declarative vs Imperative

“In imperative programming, we manually update the UI step by step. In declarative programming, we describe what the UI should look like, and the framework handles the updates automatically.”




Imperative 

- Finding the element
    
- Updating the DOM manually
    
- Controlling how UI changes





Declarative

### What YOU are doing:

- Defining state
    
- Describing UI using JSX
    
- Changing state only
    

### What REACT does:

- Detects state change
    
- Re-renders component
    
- Updates DOM automatically


## Key Difference 

|Imperative|Declarative|
|---|---|
|You update the DOM|React updates the DOM|
|You control how|You describe what|
|More error-prone|Cleaner & predictable|
