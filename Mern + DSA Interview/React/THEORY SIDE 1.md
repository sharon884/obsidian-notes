What is React?
### What problem React solves (VERY IMPORTANT)

Before React, in **plain JavaScript**:

- You manually select DOM elements
    
- You manually update the DOM when data changes
    
- For large apps, this becomes:
    
    - Slow
        
    - Hard to maintain
        
    - Bug-prone


### What React actually is

React is:

- A **JavaScript library**
    
- Built to handle **UI state changes automatically**
    
- Based on **components**




### Component-based architecture (CORE IDEA)

In React:

- UI is broken into **small reusable components**
    
- Each component:
    
    - Has its own logic
        
    - Has its own UI
        
    - Can be reused


This improves:

- Reusability
    
- Readability
    
- Maintainability



Interview-ready explanation

React is a JavaScript library used to build user interfaces. It follows a component-based architecture and uses a declarative approach, where UI updates automatically when state changes, making applications easier to manage and more performant.
