## 🧾 THE ACTUAL SQL SYNTAX ORDER (WRITE THIS WAY)

`
SELECT columns / aggregates 

FROM table 

WHERE row_conditions 

GROUP BY grouping_columns 

HAVING group_conditions 

ORDER BY column 

LIMIT number;`

📌 **This order never changes. Ever.**

## 🔄 BUT SQL EXECUTES IN THIS ORDER (IMPORTANT)

`
FROM 

WHERE 

GROUP BY

HAVING

SELECT 

ORDER BY 

LIMIT`
