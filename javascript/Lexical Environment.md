> A **Lexical Environment** is a structure that stores **variable bindings (name → value)** and the **reference to its outer environment**.
> 
> Every time JavaScript creates an **Execution context** (like when you call a function or when the script starts), a new **Lexical Environment** is also created.

**Each lexical environment has two parts:**

- **Environment Record:** stores all local variables, `const`, `let`, `var`, and function declarations.
    
- **Outer Reference:** a link to the lexical environment of its parent (where it was defined).
    

📌 **"Lexical" means based on where it’s written in the code (its position in the source code).**

Global Variables

If you create a variable outside any function, it goes into this room.

let a = 10;  // Global


### Inner Room (Inside a Function)

- If you create a variable **inside a function**, it goes into the **function’s room**.
    
- That room also **remembers where it was created** (its outer room).
    

`let a = 10;  // global  function outer() {   let b = 20; // outer function room    function inner() {     let c = 30; // inner function room     console.log(a, b, c);   }    inner(); }  outer();`

🔗 When `inner()` runs:

- First looks in **its own room** → finds `c`.
    
- If not found → goes to **outer room** → finds `b`.
    
- If still not found → goes to **global room** → finds `a`.
    

This **chain of searching** is called the **scope chain**.  
And the **rooms + the link to outer rooms** are called **lexical environments**.

## 🧠 Easy Summary

| Term                    | Meaning                                |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| **Variable Scope**      | Where a variable can be used           |
| **Lexical Environment** | The box (memory) + link to outer box   |
| **Scope Chain**         | The path JS follows to find a variable |

## 📦 Lexical Environment

- **Created when we write code (compile time)**.
    
- Every function has its own **box (environment)** with:
    
    - the **variables declared inside it**
        
    - and a **link to the outer environment**.

## 🔗 Scope Chain

- When JS **searches for a variable**:
    
    1. Looks in **inner function**.
        
    2. If not found → looks in **outer function**.
        
    3. If not found → looks in **global**.
        
- This step-by-step searching is called **scope chaining**.

## 🚫 Who Can Access Who

- **Inner function can access**:
    
    - its **own variables**
        
    - its **outer function variables**
        
    - the **global variables**
        
- **Outer function cannot access**:
    
    - the **inner function’s variables**
        

✅ Because **scope only works from outer to inner (not reverse).**
