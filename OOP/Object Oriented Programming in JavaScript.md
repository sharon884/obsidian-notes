Object Oriented Programming (OOP) is a style of programming that uses classes and objects to model real-world things like data and behavior. A class is a blueprint that defines the properties and methods an object can have, while an object is a specific instance created from that class.


Why OOP is Needed: 

Before OOP, when the code size grows and multiple people work on a project, there problems arise

- Changing in one team's code causing other codes to break. Hence difficult to maintain.
- Large number of parameters during function calls.
- Difficult to divide and maintain code across teams.
- Limited Code Reusability
- Not scalable as the code is not modular.



Object Oriented Programming (OOP) solves these problems by combining data and the functions that operate on it into a single unit called an object. This approach has following main features

- ****Encapsulation**** ensures that one team can change data representation and algorithms without causing other team's code change.
- ****Inheritance**** ensures code reuse.
- ****Polymorphism**** allows objects to behave differently using the same interface.
