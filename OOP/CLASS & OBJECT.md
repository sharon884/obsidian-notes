## What is a **Class**? (conceptual, not syntax)

### 👉 Simple definition

> A **class** is a **blueprint** that defines **what data an object will have** and **what it can do**.

### In programming terms

A class defines:

- **Properties** (data)
    
- **Methods** (behavior)

class User {
  name
  role
  login()
}


What is an **Object**?

### Simple definition

> An **object** is a **real instance created from a class**.


### Programming example

`const user1 = new User();`



## Relationship between Class & Object (IMPORTANT)

|Class|Object|
|---|---|
|Blueprint|Real thing|
|Logical|Physical (in memory)|
|No memory|Takes memory|
|One class|Many objects|


## Why do we need Class & Object?

This answers **WHY OOP EXISTS**.

Without classes:

- Data scattered
    
- Functions loosely connected
    
- Hard to control changes
    

With classes:

- Data + behavior together
    
- Clear ownership
    
- Safer changes


## One-line interview answer 

> “A class is a blueprint that defines properties and behavior, while an object is an instance of that class representing a real entity.”
