What is Method Overloading?

> **Method overloading means having the same method name with different parameters.**

Key idea:

- Same name
    
- Different number or type of arguments


## Simple real-world analogy

Think of a calculator:

- add(2, 3)
    
- add(2, 3, 4)
    

Same operation name → different inputs.

**Overloading:**
