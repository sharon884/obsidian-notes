ACID = Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability

“ACID properties in SQL are a set of guarantees that ensure database transactions are reliable and maintain data integrity.  
Atomicity means a transaction is treated as a single unit—either all operations succeed or all are rolled back.  
Consistency ensures the database moves from one valid state to another while following all constraints and rules.  
Isolation ensures that multiple transactions running concurrently do not interfere with each other.  
Durability guarantees that once a transaction is committed, the data is permanently saved, even in case of system failure.”
