## What is a **Database**?
A **database** is an **organized collection of data** stored so that it can be:

- easily **stored**
    
- easily **retrieved**
    
- easily **updated**
    
- easily **deleted**


### Technical definition

> A database is a structured collection of related data stored electronically in a computer system.



## What is **DBMS** (Database Management System)?

### Simple definition

A **DBMS** is **software** that helps you:

- create databases
    
- store data
    
- retrieve data
    
- manage data safely
    

👉 If **Database = data**,  
then **DBMS = manager of that data**

### Examples of DBMS

- MySQL
    
- PostgreSQL
    
- Oracle
    
- MongoDB
    
- SQLite

### What DBMS does for you

Without DBMS ❌:

- You manually store files
    
- No security
    
- No backup
    
- Data corruption possible
    

With DBMS ✅:

- Security (users, passwords)
    
- Backup & recovery
    
- Data consistency
    
- Query language (SQL)
    

💡 **Key idea**:  
DBMS is the **bridge** between **you** and the **database**.
