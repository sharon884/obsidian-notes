## What is TypeScript?

**TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript** developed by **Microsoft**.  
It adds **static typing** and **modern language features** on top of JavaScript and then **compiles to plain JavaScript**, which browsers can understand.

TypeScript = JavaScript + Types



Why do we use TypeScript?
### Static Typing (Main Reason)

TypeScript lets you define **types** for variables, function parameters, and return values.

`function add(a: number, b: number): number {   return a + b; }`

Errors caught **at compile time**  
❌ JavaScript catches them **at runtime**

### Fewer Bugs, Safer Code

TypeScript helps catch:

- Wrong data types
    
- Missing properties
    
- Invalid function arguments
    

This is huge for **large codebases**.

---

###  Better Developer Experience

- Auto-completion
    
- IntelliSense
    
- Safer refactoring
    
- Clear documentation via types
    

Your editor becomes smarter 

---

###  Object-Oriented Programming Support

TypeScript supports:

- Classes
    
- Interfaces
    
- Access modifiers (`public`, `private`, `protected`)
    
- Inheritance
    

Which makes **OOPS concepts** easier and cleaner.

###  Scales Well for Large Projects

JavaScript becomes hard to manage as projects grow.  
TypeScript adds **structure**, making teamwork and long-term maintenance easier.

---

###  Modern JavaScript Features

You can use:

- Optional chaining
    
- Nullish coalescing
    
- Enums
    
- Generics
    

Even if the browser doesn’t support them yet — TypeScript handles it.

## Quick Interview-Ready Answer 

> **TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that adds static typing.  
> We use it to catch errors at compile time, improve code maintainability, support OOPS concepts, and scale large applications more safely and efficiently.  
> TypeScript code is compiled into JavaScript, so it runs everywhere JavaScript runs.**
