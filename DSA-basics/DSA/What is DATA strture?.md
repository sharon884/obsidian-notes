## 🧠 **1️⃣ What is Data Structure?**

### ✅ **Interview Answer:**

A **data structure** is a way of organizing and storing data in a computer so that it can be used efficiently. It defines the relationship between data elements and the operations that can be performed on them.

### 📘 **Explanation:**

Every program handles data — whether it’s numbers, text, or records. But how you **arrange that data** in memory affects how fast and efficiently your program runs.

- Example: If you store 1 million names, a simple array might be inefficient for search operations — but a hash table or binary search tree can make it much faster.
    
- So, choosing the **right data structure** = better performance.
