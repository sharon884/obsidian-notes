DSA stands for Data  Structures and  Algorithms. Data structures manage how data is stored and accessed. Algorithms focus on processing this data. Examples of data structures are Array, Linked List, Tree and Heap, and examples of algorithms are Binary Search, Quick Sort and Merge Sort.


## Why to Learn DSA?

- Foundation for almost every software like GPS, Search Engines, AI ChatBots, Gaming Apps, Databases, Web Applications, etc
- Top Companies like Google, Microsoft, Amazon, Apple, Meta and many other heavily focus on DSA ****i****n interviews.
- Learning DSA boosts your problem-solving abilities and make you a stronger programmer.


### **What is DSA?**

**DSA** stands for **Data Structures and Algorithms**.

- **Data Structures (DS):** Ways to organize and store data so that we can access and modify it efficiently.
    
    - Examples: Arrays, Strings, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Trees, Graphs, Hash Tables.
        
    - Think of it like organizing your wardrobe: you can keep clothes in drawers, hangers, or shelves depending on how often you use them.
        
- **Algorithms (A):** Step-by-step instructions to solve a problem.
    
    - Examples: Sorting, Searching, Recursion, Dynamic Programming.
        
    - Think of it like a recipe: a clear set of steps to make a dish efficiently.
        

**So, DSA = Efficiently storing data + solving problems using that data.**
