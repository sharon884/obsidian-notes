## 3️⃣ Important Notes

- In Linux cron: tasks run independently of Node.js; system handles scheduling.

## 🔹 Interview Answer (Short Version)

> A cron job is a scheduled task. In Linux, you can create one using `crontab -e` and writing a schedule with the 5-field cron syntax. In Node.js, you can use the `node-cron` package to schedule tasks programmatically, like sending emails or cleaning databases at specific intervals.
