what is tree data structure  - A **tree** is a **non-linear data structure** used to represent this hierarchical relationship.

We use trees because hierarchical data cannot be represented efficiently using arrays, as arrays are linear and do not store parent–child relationships.

For example, in a project like **PassGo**, the main folder is the root, frontend and backend are child nodes, and their internal folders and files form further child nodes.

A tree structure clearly represents this relationship.

It is not about sorting or simple storage, but about **representing hierarchy in an organized way**.
