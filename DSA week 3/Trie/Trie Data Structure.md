The Trie ****data structure**** is used to store a set of keys represented as strings. It allows for efficient ****retrieval**** and ****storage**** of keys, making it highly effective in handling large datasets. Trie supports operations such as ****insertion****, ****search****, ****deletion**** of keys, and ****prefix**** searches.
