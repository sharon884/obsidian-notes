A Binary Heap is a special type of complete binary tree, meaning all levels are filled except possibly the last, which is filled from left to right.

- It allows fast access to the minimum or maximum element. There are two types of binary heaps: Min Heap and Max Heap.
- ****Min Heap****: The value of the root node is the smallest, and this property is true for all subtrees.
- ****Max Heap****: The value of the root node is the largest, and this rule also applies to all subtrees.
- Binary heaps are commonly used in priority queues and heap sort algorithms because of their efficient insertion and deletion operations.


### How is Binary Heap represented? 

A Binary Heap is a ****Complete Binary Tree****. A binary heap is typically represented as an array.

- The root element will be at arr[0].
- The below table shows indices of other nodes for the ith node, i.e., arr[i]:

|   |   |
|---|---|
|arr[(i-1)/2]|Returns the parent node|
|arr[(2*i)+1]|Returns the left child node|
|arr[(2*i)+2]|Returns the right child node|
