### 🌱 **Tree Terminology Quiz — Review**

**1️⃣ Root** — ✅ Correct

> The **topmost node** of a tree is called the **root node**.  
> ⭐ **Rating:** 10/10

---

**2️⃣ Leaf node** — ✅ Correct

> A **leaf node** (or terminal node) has **no children**.  
> ⭐ **Rating:** 10/10

---

**3️⃣ Edge** — ✅ Correct

> An **edge** connects a **parent node** to a **child node**.  
> ⭐ **Rating:** 10/10

---

**4️⃣ Height** — ✅ Almost perfect

> The **height** of a tree is the **longest path from the root node down to a leaf node** (measured in edges).  
> ⭐ **Rating:** 9.5/10 (your wording “longest path for root node to a leaf node” was great, just remember it’s measured in **edges**, not nodes).

---

**5️⃣ Depth** — ✅ Correct

> The **depth** of a node is the **distance (in edges)** from the **root** to that node.  
> ⭐ **Rating:** 10/10

---

**6️⃣ Root count** — ✅ Correct

> A **tree can have only one root node**. If there are multiple roots, it’s not one tree — it’s a **forest**.  
> ⭐ **Rating:** 10/10

---

**7️⃣ Subtree** — ✅ Correct and nicely explained

> A **subtree** is any **child node along with its descendants** — basically, a smaller tree within a larger one.  
> ⭐ **Rating:** 10/10

---

**8️⃣ Siblings** — ✅ Correct

> Nodes that share the same **parent node** are called **siblings**.  
> ⭐ **Rating:** 10/10

---

**9️⃣ General Tree vs Binary Tree** — ⚠️ Needs small correction

> ✅ You’re right that a **general tree** has **no restriction** on the number of children each node can have.  
> ❌ But a **binary tree** has a **maximum of two children** (usually called `left` and `right`).

⭐ **Rating:** 8/10 (just missed the exact definition of a binary tree)

---

**🔟 Degree of a Node** — ⚠️ Needs correction

> ❌ “If node has no children, that node is called degree” — not quite.  
> ✅ The **degree of a node** means the **number of direct children** that node has.  
> Example:
> 
> - Node with 0 children → degree = 0 (leaf)
>     
> - Node with 3 children → degree = 3
>
