A graph is a [non-linear data structure](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dsa/introduction-to-hierarchical-data-structure/) made up of vertices (nodes) and edges (connections) that represent relationships between objects. Unlike arrays or linked lists, graphs do not follow a sequential order.  
Example: On a map, each city is a vertex, and each road connecting two cities is an edge. This way, a graph represents how cities are linked.

## Components of Graph Data Structure

- ****Vertices:**** Vertices are the fundamental units of the graph. Sometimes, vertices are also known as vertex or nodes. Every node/vertex can be labeled or unlabelled.
- ****Edges:**** Edges are drawn or used to connect two nodes of the graph. It can be ordered pair of nodes in a directed graph. Edges can connect any two nodes in any possible way. There are no rules. Sometimes, edges are also known as arcs. Every edge can be labelled/unlabelled.

## Types Of Graphs in Data Structure and Algorithms

A graph can be divided into multiple categories based on different properties such as edges, direction, connectivity and many others.

## Based on weight :

### 1. Weighted Graphs

A ****weighted graph**** is a graph where each edge has a number (weight) that represents distance, cost, or time.
