1. **Queue is a linear data structure**
    
    - Yes, 100% correct.
        
    - It stores data **one by one** in a specific order and follows **FIFO (First In, First Out)**.
        
2. **Used for CPU task scheduling & asynchronous operations**
    
    - Correct again ‚úÖ
        
    - In **Node.js**, the **Event Loop** uses **queues** (like Callback Queue, Microtask Queue, etc.)
        
        - They store **asynchronous tasks** (e.g., `setTimeout`, promises, I/O callbacks).
            
        - When the **call stack** becomes empty, the **event loop dequeues** one callback and executes it.
            
3. **Adding elements ‚Üí Enqueue operation**
    
    - You nailed this üëç
        
    - When a new task is ready, it‚Äôs **added to the rear (end)** of the queue.
        
4. **Removing elements ‚Üí Dequeue operation**
    
    - Also correct ‚úÖ
        
    - The event loop (or CPU scheduler) **removes the first element (front)** from the queue to process it.
        
5. **About Overflow & Underflow:**
    
    - Small correction here üëá
        
        - In a **fixed-size queue**,
            
            - **Overflow** happens when you try to add an element but the queue is already full.
                
            - **Underflow** happens when you try to remove (dequeue) but the queue is empty.
                
        - In Node.js‚Äôs **internal queues**, these are dynamically managed, so they **don‚Äôt overflow** ‚Äî tasks just wait their turn.

### ‚ö° Final Interview Version:

> ‚ÄúA queue is a linear data structure that follows the FIFO principle. It‚Äôs used in real systems like Node.js to handle asynchronous tasks efficiently.  
> When new tasks are ready, they‚Äôre enqueued at the end of the queue, and the event loop dequeues them one by one for execution when the call stack is empty.  
> In fixed-size queues, overflow occurs if we try to enqueue when full, and underflow occurs if we try to dequeue when empty.‚Äù
