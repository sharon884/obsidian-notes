A ****Queue Data Structure**** is a fundamental concept in computer science used for storing and managing data in a specific order.

- It follows the principle of "****First in, First out****" ****(FIFO)****, where the first element added to the queue is the first one to be removed.
- It is used as a buffer in computer systems where we have speed mismatch between two devices that communicate with each other. For example, CPU and keyboard and two devices in a network
- Queue is also used in Operating System algorithms like CPU Scheduling and Memory Management, and many standard algorithms like Breadth First Search of Graph, Level Order Traversal of a Tree.
