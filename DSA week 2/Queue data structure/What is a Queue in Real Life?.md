A **queue** is just like a **line** of people waiting for something —  
👉 the **first person who comes** is the **first person to be served**.

That’s why it’s called **FIFO (First In, First Out)**.

Example:

`[Person1, Person2, Person3] 
↑ Front (Person1 will go first)`

Now, in computers, this same idea is applied in **many real-world scenarios** where **tasks, data, or requests** are waiting to be processed **in order**.

## ⚙️ 2. Why Do We Need a Queue in Computer Systems?

Because in real systems, **some components work faster than others.**  
That’s what your line says 👇

> “It is used as a buffer in computer systems where we have speed mismatch between two devices that communicate with each other.”

Let’s understand that with examples 👇

---

### 💻 Example 1: Keyboard and CPU

- The **keyboard** sends signals (key presses) one by one.
    
- The **CPU** processes them **much faster**.
    

If CPU tried to process every single key press immediately, sometimes it might read incomplete signals.

So instead, we use a **queue (buffer)** between them:

`Keyboard → [Q: a, b, c, d] → CPU`

- Keyboard puts key signals **in the queue**.
    
- CPU takes them **one by one** from the queue when ready.
    

👉 This ensures **no data loss** and **smooth processing**.

### 🌐 Example 2: Network Communication

In networking, data packets often arrive at different speeds.

- The **sender** might send data fast.
    
- The **receiver** might process it slower.
    

So the receiver stores incoming packets in a **queue (buffer)**.

`Sender → [Queue: packet1, packet2, packet3] → Receiver`

The receiver then reads the packets **in order** (FIFO), ensuring data integrity.

### 🖨️ Example 3: Printer Queue

- When you send multiple print jobs, they go into a **print queue**.
    
- The printer prints one document at a time, **in the same order they arrived**.
    

`Job1 → Job2 → Job3   (Prints Job1 first)`

## ⚡ 3. Why Queue Works Perfectly Here

Because all these cases have something in common:

|Scenario|Producer (Fast)|Consumer (Slow)|Why Queue?|
|---|---|---|---|
|Keyboard & CPU|Keyboard|CPU|To handle key signals orderly|
|Network|Sender|Receiver|To store packets until ready|
|Printer|Multiple users|Printer|To process print jobs in order|

So the **queue acts as a buffer (temporary storage)** that manages the difference in processing speeds.

## 🧠 4. Concept Summary

|Concept|Description|
|---|---|
|**Data Structure Type**|Linear|
|**Order Rule**|FIFO – First In, First Out|
|**Operations**|Enqueue (Add), Dequeue (Remove)|
|**Used For**|Buffers, scheduling, task management|
|**Examples**|Keyboard buffer, print queue, network buffer|

So basically Champ —

> A **queue** helps to maintain order and stability between **two processes or devices that work at different speeds**.
