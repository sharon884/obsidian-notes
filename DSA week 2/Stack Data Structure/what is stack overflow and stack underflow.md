When a stack is **full** and we try to **push** a new element, the operation **fails** because there’s **no more space** — this is called **stack overflow**.

When a stack is **empty** and we try to **pop** an element, the operation **fails** because there’s **nothing to remove** — this is called **stack underflow**.

In both cases, the operation (push or pop) **does not happen**, and the program might show an **error message** or **throw an exception** depending on how it’s coded.
