A ****Stack**** is a linear data structure that follows a particular order in which the operations are performed. The order may be ****LIFO(Last In First Out)**** or ****FILO(First In Last Out)****. ****LIFO**** implies that the element that is inserted last, comes out first and ****FILO**** implies that the element that is inserted first, comes out last.

It behaves like a stack of plates, where the last plate added is the first one to be removed. ****Think of it this way:****

Pushing an element onto the stack is like adding a new plate on top.

Popping an element removes the top plate from the stack.
