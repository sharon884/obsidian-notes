## ****What is Hash Table?****

A Hash table is defined as a data structure used to insert, look up, and remove key-value pairs quickly. It operates on theÂ [hashing concept](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dsa/what-is-hashing/), where each key is translated by a hash function into a distinct index in an array. The index functions as a storage location for the matching value. In simple words, it maps the keys with the value.
