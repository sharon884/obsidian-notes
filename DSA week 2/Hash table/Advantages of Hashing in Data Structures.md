## Advantages of Hashing in Data Structures

- ****Key-value support:**** Hashing is ideal for implementing key-value data structures.
- ****Fast data retrieval:**** Hashing allows for quick access to elements with constant-time complexity.
- ****Efficiency:**** Insertion, deletion, and searching operations are highly efficient.
- ****Memory usage reduction:**** Hashing requires less memory as it allocates a fixed space for storing elements.
- ****Scalability:**** Hashing performs well with large data sets, maintaining constant access time.
- ****Security and encryption:**** Hashing is essential for secure data storage and integrity verification.
