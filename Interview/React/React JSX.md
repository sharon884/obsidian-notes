JSX stands for JavaScript XML, and it is a special syntax used in React to simplify building user interfaces. JSX allows you to write HTML-like code directly inside JavaScript, enabling you to create UI components more efficiently. Although JSX looks like regular HTML, it’s actually a syntax extension for JavaScript.

How JSX Works

When React processes this JSX code, it converts it into JavaScript using Babel. This JavaScript code then creates real HTML elements in the browser’s DOM . which is how your web page gets displayed.


> Note: Babel acts as a ****translator**** for your React code. It takes modern JavaScript (like JSX) that browsers don't understand directly. Finally, it converts it into older, compatible JavaScript so your application runs everywhere.
